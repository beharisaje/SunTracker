Overview
This project implements a solar panel sun-tracking system using an Arduino, an RTC (DS3231), and an A4988 stepper motor driver.
It is composed of two main code files:

Main Sun Tracker Code – actively tracks the sun across the day, adjusting azimuth and elevation.

Simulation Code – simulates a full day's mechanical movement for system testing and tuning without real-time tracking.

Both systems control a mechanically geared solar tracker with specific steps-per-revolution settings.
